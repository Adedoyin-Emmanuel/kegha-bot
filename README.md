# Kegha Bot üöÄ

**Kegha** is a telegram bot that allows users to create wallet, create, view and update **BOS** profile all from the bot.

## Inspiration üß†\*

We wanted to create a bot that could map telegram account Id's to BOS account profile enhancing users identification.

## How We Built It üñ•Ô∏è

Though it was tough since it was our first time working on anything related to **Blockchain** but we pulled through. We built the bot interface with **Telegraf** and for the BOS, we used **Near-API-JS**. It was easy and convenient to set up. We ran into errors but that kept us going.

## How IT Works üöÄ

Kegha creates a new **Near** account for users with any username they want so far it isn't taken. It t\*hen logs them in and allows them to carry out actions like fetching their **BOS** profile, updating their **BOS** profile, viewing account balance, transaction history and all.

## What's Next?

Although kegha does what it was built to do. But in the future, we hope to build this into a more robost bot that would allow users to do the following.

1. Mint NTFS
2. Post to **Near Social** <https://near.social>
3. Export their private keys.
4. Mine a vibe.
5. Bot settings.
6. Transfer NFT
7. Transfer NEAR/Token
8. Help/ Support
